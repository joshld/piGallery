Start with `PROJECT_BOARD_QUICK_START.md` (5 min) to create your board, then read `GITHUB_TODO_GUIDE.md` for detailed usage.

Yes! Keep them for reference. GitHub issues are now your primary tracking system, but local files are useful for quick notes.

### "What if I want to add more features?"
Create new issues with `gh issue create` or on GitHub. Add them to your board by typing `#` in the "Add item" field.
